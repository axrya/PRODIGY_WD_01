🌐 Responsive Navigation Menu
This project is part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech as a Web Development Intern. It is my first task in the program, where I developed an interactive navigation menu using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The menu features a fixed position, a responsive layout, and dynamic styling based on scroll behavior and user interaction.
